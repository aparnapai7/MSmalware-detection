# MSmalware-detection
Malware prediction for Microsoft machines (Based on Kaggle competition)

This academic project is based on the Kaggle competition hosted by Microsoft to build a classifier to predict if the Windows machines shall be affected by a Malware or not, based on a wide set of features. The link to the dataset and further details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data)

## The aim of this project were as follows  
- Learning how to build machine learning models on a large dataset using Apache Spark framework (via Google Colab)
- Getting hands-on with pusing data in AWS S3 data bucket and building models using AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) instance

## Process 
- The dataset included 167 features and 1 Million+ rows 
- Pre processing was performed using Python 
- The model bulding and training was performed using PySpark, via Google Colab notebook initally
- Once the code was functionally viable, the data was pushed to AWS S3 bucket 
- EMR cluster was established with one master and 2 slave nodes and was connected to the S3 bucket
- The PySpark code was then deployed in the EMR instance to train models and show results
